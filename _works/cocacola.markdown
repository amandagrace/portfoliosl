question: How can gesture controls be incorporated into the Coca&#8209;Cola ordering experience?
summary: Coca-Cola Enterprises needed an experimental gesture menu prototype that it could showcase at an international conference and potentially market to cafés in Europe. But rather than asking how we could include gesture controls in the ordering experience, we should have asked how – or if – the experience could be improved by these controls.
