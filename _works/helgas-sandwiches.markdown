snippet: An e-commerce microsite created for a sandwich sharing campaign
description: Helga's Say It With Sandwiches campaign delivered hundreds of gourmet
  sandwiches throughout Sydney and Melbourne so that people could show they care with
  an act of kindness. The $5 sandwiches were sold via a Shopify microsite to raise
  money for Food Bank Australia, and a virtual sandwich maker allowed people to show
  they care outside of the delivery zones.
question: How can someone show they care with a sandwich, even from far away?
