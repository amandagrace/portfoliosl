snippet: An e-commerce solution for a whisky subscription service
description: Whisky Loot, an in-house venture of We Are Visionists, is a subscription
  service that delivers three premium whisky tasters each month. By providing simple,
  affordable access to a variety of whisky from around the world and tasting notes
  to match, it hopes to help amateurs refine their taste and find the whisky they
  enjoy best. To do this, it required a heavily customised e-commerce solution to
  meet business needs and objectives, as well as a brand implementation that's sophisticated
  yet inclusive and aspirational.
