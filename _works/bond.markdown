question: How can the Bond Intelligent Care experience be effectively condensed into an SDK?
summary: Bond Intelligent Care, a mobile application that connects patients with physicians via video,
  needed a simplified SDK experience that other developers could use in their own
  applications. Since the SDK may be the first touchpoint for many users
  and the service is a higher involvement purchase, the experience must
  build user trust quickly through the onboarding process.
